2. We tested our program's correctness mostly using the unit tests given to us. However, we also considered niche cases that were not covered
by the given unit tests, drawing diagrams out on paper to get a better idea of how our program behaves given various test lists.

3. This lab was challenging because complicated functions involving linked lists often require multiple pointers to be declared, making sure
we still had access to certain nodes when moving pointers and calling other linked list functions. Drawing out the list made it easier to
see what the next step in a function should be.
